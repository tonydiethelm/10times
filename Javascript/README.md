# Javascript

I can put my script inline, or have the HTML call it. Pretty basic setup, no transpilers or bundlers needed for something this small and basic. 

Not obvious what's going on from looking at HTML, need to look at the script. 

We have to do everything
* get dom element
* create new elements
* insert into DOM
* save data to local storage for refreshes/lifecycle. 
* handle event listener for form submit. 
* There is no CSS
