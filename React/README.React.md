# React

Started with create-react-app, just to see what it put where. I want to see the defaults. 

Standard React, we have Public/index.html with a root div, calling src/index.js which renders the app component onto the root div.

This requires webpack to bundle, and a transpiler to transpile JSX, TS, and JS to earlier version of JS. 

I have inherited some basic CSS from the default setup. 

Older is class based, newer is function based. Confusing if you have both! 

Note the input updates state every time a button is pressed. Not Ideal?

Note that UI is mixed with function declarations, setting up state. Kind of a mess, especially as app gets bigger. 

Can't put inline JS comments inside JSX/HTML. Kinda annoying. 

form input fields can't use standard closing tags? Weird. It's JSX.
