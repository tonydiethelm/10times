# React

Started with create-react-app, just to see what it put where. I want to see the defaults. 

Standard React, we have Public/index.html with a root div, calling src/index.js which renders the app component onto the root div.

This requires webpack to bundle, and a transpiler to transpile JSX, TS, and JS to earlier version of JS.
